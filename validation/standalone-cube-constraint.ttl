# Standalone Cube Constraint - Standard Cube Profile
#
# This is the standard SHACL shape for validating RDF Data Cubes with minimal metadata.
# All cubes should pass this validation to ensure they contain the minimum required
# metadata properties and structure.
#
# This shape imports standalone-constraint-constraint which validates the cube's
# observation constraints and dimensions.
